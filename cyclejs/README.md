# Body Mass Index calculator, using Javascript + CycleJS

[CycleJS](http://cycle.js.org/) is a fully reactive JavaScript framework for
Human-Computer Interaction.

This version uses the [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).
First install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then:

```
git clone https://github.com/magopian/bmi-calculator-polyglot
cd bmi-calculator-polyglot/cyclejs
make install
make serve
make watch  # In another terminal.
open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
```

Modifying the files (`index.html`, `scripts.es6/index.js`)
will auto-reload them in the browser.
